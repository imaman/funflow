// TODO:
// - in flowTrace ouput should be displayed next to the computation name
// - an abandon operator: abandon({ after: 100, unit: 'millis', with: [err,
// value], dsl1, dsl2, dsl3, ...)
// - execution should also be a function? Decision: currenty not as it can only
// be invoked once so it's is not a really a function that can be dispatched
// freely.
// - flowTrace should contain a legend
// - register shutdown (a.k.a finalize) callbacks
// - in the flowTrace outputs should be keyed by their creation order
// - flowTrace should indicate executed computations
// - flowTrace should indicate failed computations
// - reduce depth (passed to util.inspect()) used for showing the outputs in a
// flowTrace?
// - allow a merge function to take errors
// - be able to name standard flow function (i.e., that take (v, next)).
// Currently, the comp() operator allows naming only (e, v, next) functions.
// - get rid of the _temp_ IDs attached to nodes.
// - operator: sync function
//
